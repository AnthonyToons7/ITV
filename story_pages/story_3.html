                                After Ray's defeat, a mysterious staircase appeared, leading to a mysterious place in the clouds...
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                Valiantly, he ran up the stairs, which looked like it had no end...
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                After hours and hours of running, he finally reached the top.
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                There was a figure in the distance...
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                Void slowly walked towards it, holding his sword in his hand.
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                When he came close, the figure turned around.
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                It was an angel with bright red eyes, holding a lance, pointing towards Void...
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                Void backed off in fear, as he was looking at his best friend, corrupted and controlled...
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                Left with no other option, Void engaged in his last battle...
