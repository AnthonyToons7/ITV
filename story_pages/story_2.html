                                After winning a tough battle, a mysterious portal appeared, with no one else left to destroy, Void jumped in it...
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                He wandered around, wondering where he ended up...
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                Blood was all over the grey, cold walls...
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                It looked... familiar, somehow
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                Void slowly started realising where he was...
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                He was back in the hellish facility, the same one from 4 years ago.
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                A guy with white hair and red eyes walked up to him
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                "Welcome back" he said, as he grabbed his pistol out of his holster...
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                "Didn't expect to see you here. Was living alone too hard for you?" he said.
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                Void clenched his fists. "I'm not here to deal with your business, but if you insist, I will"
