                                Hello overyone
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                Thank you so much for playing Mastery Test: RPG.
                                <br><br>
                                I spent so much time on this project, and all I can say is that I'm happy of how this turned out. This started as a one battle slot machine, and now it is a true, short storyline.
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                I'm sad to say that the game won't be getting huge updates like this anymore. It's done. All I will add from here on is minor balance changes.
                                <br><br><br><br><br>         
                                But stay tuned, because there's ONE more update after this. I promise you that it will be a good update. Though, I will not say a lot about it, it has to be a surprise after all.                       
                                <br><br><br><br><br>
                                Also, I'm working on a new game! I will occasionally show a teaser on one of my socials! Stay tuned!           
                                <br><br><br><br><br>
                                Thank you so much
