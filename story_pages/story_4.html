                                Finally, the battle was over...
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                Void ran up to his only friend, saddened by what he has just done.
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                He spent years looking for a way to get his friend back. And now, he had to kill her.
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                Void felt broken, holding her hand as he cried.
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                "I-I'm sorry... Kite... I'm so terribly sorry"
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                He started looking around him, trying to find help, but there was nothing.
                                <br><br>
                                Kite bled more and more, her pulse only going slower.
                                <br><br>
                                "I don't want to lose you again... please..."
                                <br><br><br><br>
                                Everything went quiet after that...
