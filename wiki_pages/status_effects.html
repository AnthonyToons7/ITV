                    <h2>Bleed</h2>
                    <img src="/1Mastery_Test_RPG_port_ver/img/effects/bleedingeff.gif" class="icons" alt="">
                    <p>Bleed is a status effect that takes effect every turn. Most of the time, it will stay for 2 turns. Lucky charm will negate this effect.</p>
                    <h2>Paralyze</h2>
                    <img src="/1Mastery_Test_RPG_port_ver/img/effects/shockeff.gif" alt="" class="icons">
                    <p>Paralyze takes effect as soon as it's your turn. It locks you out of your offensive attack options, only leaving you with the option to heal, buff, or use your lucky charm. This effect usually last a couple turns.</p>
                    <h2>Stun</h2>
                    <img src="/1Mastery_Test_RPG_port_ver/img/effects/stuneff.gif" alt="" class="icons">
                    <p>Stun is a straight forward status effect. It locks you out of doing anything, leaving you with the only option to skip your turn. Lasts for one turn. Lucky charm does not prevent this.</p>
                    <h2>Poison</h2>
                    <img src="/1Mastery_Test_RPG_port_ver/img/effects/Poisoneff.gif" alt="" class="icons">
                    <p>Poison is a weaker version of bleed, but lasts for a longer amount of time. Lucky charm does not prevent this.</p>
                    <h2>Burn</h2>
                    <img src="/1Mastery_Test_RPG_port_ver/img/effects/Burneff.gif" alt="" class="icons">
                    <p>Burn lasts for a very long time, dealing damage to both players. Lucky charm will not prevent this.</p>
                    <h2>Pressure</h2>
                    <img src="/1Mastery_Test_RPG_port_ver/img/effects/pressure.gif" alt="" class="icons">
                    <p>Pressure is a status effect that can be seen in either a good way, or a bad way. Pressure increases the damage of your regular attack, but gives it a chance to miss. This effect cannot be negated by a lucky charm.</p>
                    <h2>Anti-crit-shield</h2>
                    <img src="/1Mastery_Test_RPG_port_ver/img/effects/Shield.gif" alt="" class="icons">

                    <img src="/1Mastery_Test_RPG_port_ver/img/effects/atkboost.gif" alt="" class="icons">
                    <p>Boost is a buff icon. When this appears, you or the opponent is buffed. Be careful when using it, because this effect can be negated with a lucky charm.</p>

                    <img src="/1Mastery_Test_RPG_port_ver/img/effects/Crazedcresteff.gif" alt="" class="icons">
                    <p>Explosive overdrive is an effect that activates when Void has used too much magic.
