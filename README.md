# Into the Void
My old JS RPG game I made when I just knew what JS was.

## About
The game is an RPG (Role Playing Game). You switch between your turn and your opponent, hitting eachother left and right, until one falls.

## Sprites
This game uses sprites, but not in the way you'd expect. The game uses GIF files, not spritesheets. The reason why I didn't use spritesheets and game loops, is because I didn't know how HTML canvas worked, how spritesheets worked, or how to make a working game loop.
